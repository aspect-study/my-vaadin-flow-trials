# 📚 Vaadin Flow Study Project

This repository is a personal learning space where I explore and experiment with the full range of [Vaadin Flow](https://vaadin.com/flow) components and features — from layouting and data binding to routing, theming, and integration with Java backend logic.

As a Java developer, my goal is to understand not just how to use Vaadin, but how it works under the hood: how components behave, how state is managed, and how to build clean, modular UIs using Java alone.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is not a production-ready app — it's a **living lab** for studying:

- 🧩 Vaadin Flow components and their APIs
- 🎨 Layout behavior and styling (Lumo, Flexbox, CSS Grid)
- 🔄 Data binding, forms, and validation
- 🧭 Routing, navigation, and view composition
- 🌗 Theming (light/dark mode) and dynamic styling
- 🧰 Utility patterns for reusable UI logic
- 🧪 Integration with Java backend logic and design principles
